# AWS Security Monitoring and Detection Lab

This project demonstrates the deployment of a real-world AWS detection pipeline using Terraform, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and SNS. It simulates access key creation events and triggers alerting mechanisms to emulate real-world security operations use cases.

All infrastructure was provisioned using Terraform and automatically torn down to avoid incurring ongoing AWS charges.

## Tools Used

- **Terraform**
- **AWS CloudTrail**
- **AWS CloudWatch**
- **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
- **IAM**
- **AWS CLI**
- **Linux CLI (EndeavourOS)**
- **PowerShell (Windows Server)**

## Skills Demonstrated

**Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):**  
Provisioned a CloudTrail log pipeline, IAM roles, CloudWatch metric filters, alarms, and SNS topics entirely via Terraform, ensuring reproducibility and version control.

**Security Detection Engineering:**  
Created a CloudWatch metric filter and alarm to detect the creation of new IAM access keys â€” a common privilege escalation or credential leak vector.

**Automated Alerting via SNS:**  
Integrated SNS to automatically email security alerts triggered by CloudWatch alarms. Successfully received actionable alert messages within seconds of access key creation.

**Access Key Lifecycle Management:**  
Created and deleted keys to trigger alert conditions, showcasing practical experience with IAM operations and verifying end-to-end pipeline integrity.

**CloudTrail Audit Logging:**  
Configured CloudTrail to log management events across multiple AWS services and store them in a dedicated S3 bucket for audit and retention.

## Notes

- All components were destroyed after demonstration using `terraform destroy`.
- Sensitive access key data and ARNs have been redacted.
- The optional Windows agent component was removed due to compatibility issues with `onPrem` mode in the CloudWatch Agent.
- This lab was executed on EndeavourOS with AWS CLI v2 and Terraform 1.8+.
